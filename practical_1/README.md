## 5. Docker Usage

The application can be containerized using Docker for consistent deployment across environments.

### 5.1 Docker Configuration

The application uses a multi-stage build process with the following key components:

- **Base image**: Node.js 22.18 Alpine (lightweight)
- **Build process**: Installs dependencies and builds production assets
- **Production server**: Serves static files using a lightweight HTTP server
- **Port exposure**: Exposes port 3000 for web access
